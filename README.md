## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

**This is the command you'll want to run to view the page in your browser, or visit** [the live deployment of the website.](https://paulmreese.com)
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
