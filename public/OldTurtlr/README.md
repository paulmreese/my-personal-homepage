### Running Turtlr

To Run Turtlr, download a copy of this repository, and then open the included index.html file in your preferred browser.

Alternatively, you may simply visit [my portfolio](http://paulmreese.com/turtlr) to see it live online.

### Playing Turtlr

Turtlr is a Loggerhead Sea Turtle, and your mission is to help 5 newborn hatchlings make it to the freedom and safety of the ocean! Before they can enjoy their lives in the sea, however, these young ones must escape the natural and man-made dangers of the beach!

By controlling one hatchling at a time, **use the arrow keys or on-screen buttons** to move your character across the beach. If you collide with an enemy, you'll have to start again from the bottom row!

If you make it to the sea, a marker will be placed on that tile to let the next hatchling know to find another way into the ocean! You can move onto this tile, but you won't make it into the ocean(and these young ones **can't move between ocean tiles!**), so you'll want to get back on the beach and find your own way to sea!

Once all 5 water tiles have been occupied by a baby turtle, **You Win!**

### Special Thanks
